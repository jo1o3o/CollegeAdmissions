# Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.5.

## Prerequisites

- Install angular cli (`npm install -g @angular/cli`). This should install the latest version.

## Run Client

1. Open a command prompt and cd into the client directory. Run `ng serve --open` to run the angular application. Your browser should open and automatically navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. If for some reason it doesn't, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
